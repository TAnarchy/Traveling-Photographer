Run rake db:seed to load sample data

An application developed by me in Ruby on rails, currently a work in progress.
It is made for a school photographer who travels regulary and needs to keep track
of a variety of things including, schools traveled, distance traveled, time. Currently
the photographer is using an Excel spreadsheet, the process is slow and tedius.
I hope to speed up the process by creating an online connection allowing access
anywhere, and setting up a connection to Google Maps using Google Maps web services
requiring minimal data input.
